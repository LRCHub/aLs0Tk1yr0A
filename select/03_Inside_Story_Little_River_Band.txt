Graham Goble and Stephen Housden
Deadline, the beasts have come to life,
The silence has been spoken, they'll have their way tonight,
Headline, a secret agony,
Rumors can be proven, there's a picture on page three.
Gonna bring you the inside story,
Run it as a front page spread,
Gonna tell you the inside story,
Did you hear what the victim said?
Showtime, and there's anger at the scene,
Our star is under pressure, get his face up on the screen,
Wild eyes, as the car is rushed away,
Your shame is what they feed on, and we read everything they say.
Gonna bring you the inside story,
Run it as a front page spread,
Get a load of the inside story,
Did you hear what the victim said,
Gonna bring you the inside story,
Play it on the nighly news,
Doesn't matter how we get the story,
Doesn't matter who we have to use.
If the city closes up their thrill is gone,
They no longer hold the keys to Babylon,
So they wait in towers built to ill advise,
For another famous head to vicimize.
Hard time, for the guy who played to win,
They claim he's been broken,
He'll have to fight to save his skin.
Gonna bring you the inside story,

Gonna bring you the inside story,

Doesn't matter how we get the story,
Doesn't matter who we have to use.
