It's like something just over the horizon,
Wanna take a walk, maybe see what we can find,
Look long and hard, look near and far,
But above all things remember always look inside,

Listen in into these words from a citizen of earths surface, lets try and
Rewire the circuits, determine the purpose
Meanwhile i'm striving for perfect but homie perfect takes practice, and im
Finding these days and times i'm always so damn distracted,

They hit you like, shop here, wear this, want this, love this, be this, buy
This, buy that,
Log in, sign up, tune in, click here, watch this, read up, write back,

So much too know, and so many things to own,
Tv in your home and your mobile phone make sure that your never really
Alone
And its pathetic, like a global epidemic,
Attention span so fragmented,
So addicted to being connected,
We now getting updates by the second,
Got us all time wasting,
But the whole world look, getting high on information.

Post-generation y babies they call them the digital natives, hide behind
Their monitors,
This technology kills imagination, excuse my cynicism, But a world where
Every kids best friend is a computer, is a system failure headed for an
Apathetic future.

Just a few centuries back they made maps of a flat world by candle light
Now the whole worlds at your fingertips, map right down to your street by
Satellite,
So advanced from where we started its all so complexified,
Brand names buy ad-space in your mind, but they'll never get whats
Inside.

I wasn't there when they wrote the rules, but I do my best to follow them
In this world of machines, we starving for oxygen
All I can offer is these words that I write and I only give them what I know
So I give them what's inside

Said I wasn't there when they wrote the rules, but I do my best to follow
Them in this world of machines, we starving for oxygen,
Where were you the day that humanity died, searching for signs of life to
Reconnect with what's inside

Somewhere there's a room full of men in suits looking up at rows of
Numbers,
Terrified by the red in the eyes, as arrows point down from the pressure
Their under,
They say we might drown in our own greediness, living beyond our means,
Chasing dreams that we learn off MTV cribs

Look at what we did, smog fills the sky and the cars line up at the servo,
And I can't help but think to myself this can't be the way it was supposed
To go

On the nightly news floods and bushfires, earthquakes and tidal waves,
Temperatures rising, army's fighting, bombs go off and sirens blaze
We just trying to get by and occupy our spot on the timeline,
So we change the channel to sex, drugs and violence program for prime
Time,
Sit back in our chairs as a living room voyeurism, as reality TV turns all of
Life into a competition,

Airbrushed magazine pages give us false idols to worship, got us all so
Depressed, we can't live up to picture perfect,
Sometimes I just want to unplug and go back to basics, and I wonder what
My story might have been like somewhere else in history's pages,

But here we stand, sons and daughters of colonialism crossed over water
Just to be making our homes on stolen land, and me,
I don't know the plan, i'm just here to play my part, do my thing, walk my
Path, fork my shit, make my mark, I swear I want to make a difference
From the bottom of my heart,
But I don't how to fix it, man, I wouldn't know where to start, so advanced
From where we started, images of the production line, we out of touch
With what's inside,

I wasn't there when they wrote the rules,
But I do my best to follow them in this world of machines, we starving for
Oxygen,
All I can offer is these words that I write and I only give them what I know
So I give them what's inside,

Said I wasn't there when they wrote the rules, but I do my best to follow
Them in this world of machines, we starving for oxygen,
Where were you the day that humanity died, searching for signs of life to
Reconnect with what's inside
