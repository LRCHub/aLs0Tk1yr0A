(Spoken)
Dark Star: Still here? Has the dark power not crushed your puny hopes? Soon, this kingdom will vanish along with all who dwell within. And you, too, will sleep eternally in the dark power's embrace!
Bowser: GWAHAHA! Great dark hurricane! Seriously, perfect backdrop for an awesome final battle! You really sweat the details! [beat] Listen up! You're saying the kingdom will vanish? NOT TODAY! THIS KINGDOM IS ALL MINE! SO YOU VANISH! [SHOWTIME!]
(Song)
Dark Star:
Let your hopes be blown away
The Dark Star will shine
And annihilate the day
Inside the hearts of man I see the darkness beckoning
You deal with a power far beyond your reckoning
Drown in shadow black as tar
Under blackest light! Under darkest stars!
I will rise! And the stars will fall!
All who dare to stand shall be made to crawl!
And in the final hour of fading light
Your dreams of peace cast aside
Scattered like dust in the night
And in the final hour, my star will shine
Starlight and powers aligned
In the final fight!
Inside the hearts of man I see the darkness beckoning
You deal with a power far beyond your reckoning
Bowser:
Well lookie here, it’s even had a little speech prepared!
You done with monologues? ‘Cause it’s my turn, you should be scared!
Took my style? Well, I’m impressed
Even copycats
Want to copy the best
But I got no patience for imposters trying to take the throne
I am the Koopa King! You dare defy? I’ll break your bones!
I have conquered galaxies
Now I have stepped down to see
If a shadow can bleed
Koopa King will strike you down
I’ll put you back in the ground
Learn why I wear the crown
And in the final hour of fading light
No one can challenge my might
Not while the fire burns bright
And in the final hour, my star will shine
Starlight and powers aligned
In the final fight!
What’s wrong there, critter? Are you just a little parasite?
Hope you don’t mind that fighting tends to build an appetite!
Mario and Luigi:
(Luigi, look the core!) (Hey, this is our chance, Mario!)
Let’s finish off this star! You ready, bro? Let’s-a go!
In the journey we’ve come far
And now here we are
Now you see Superstars!
Luigi:
If you’re still in there, Fawful, know you still made one mistake
Mario:
Thinking that we could never find a way to save the day!
Bros:
We will hold our hammers high
Watch a star fall
As we soar through the sky
We will rise! Brothers hand in hand!
We will never crawl! And here we stand!
And in the final hour of fading light
Dreams of peace taking flight
Pushing back the night
And in the final hour, our star will shine
Starlight and powers aligned
In the final fight!
Dark Star: Inside the hearts of man I see a darkness beckoning
Bowser: You are a fool to try and stand against the Koopa King!
Mario and Luigi: To save the kingdoms, fight for everyone and everything
All: The finale approaches, now a victory we’ll sing!
Mario and Luigi:
In the journey we’ve come far
And now here we are
Now you see Superstars!
Dark Star:
Inside the hearts of man I see the darkness beckoning
You deal with a power far beyond your reckoning
Dark Star and Bowser:
Dreams in darkness crash and burn
Now it’s time you learn
Bowser: Now it’s my turn!
Dark Star and Mario/Luigi:
We will rise! And the star(s) will fall!
Mario and Luigi:
We will bring the light back to all!
Mario, Luigi, and Bowser:
And in the final hour of fading light
Stand tall against the night
While our hopes burn bright!
All:
And in the final hour, our star will shine
Starlight and powers aligned
In the final fight!
