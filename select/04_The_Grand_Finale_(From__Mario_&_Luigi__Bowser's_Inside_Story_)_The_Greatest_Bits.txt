Pre-Battle Dialogue

Dark Star:
Still here? Has the dark power not crushed your puny hopes?

Soon this kingdom will vanish along with all who dwell within

And you, too, will sleep eternally in the dark power's embrace!

GWAHAHA!

Great dark hurricane!

Seriously, perfect backdrop for an awesome final battle!

You really sweat the details!

Listen up! You're saying the kingdom will vanish?

NOT TODAY! THIS KINGDOM IS ALL MINE! SO YOU VANISH! Showtime!

Dark Star:
Let your hopes be blown away
The Dark Star will shine
And annihilate the day Inside the hearts of man
I see the darkness beckoning
You deal with a power far beyond your reckoning

Drown in shadow black as tar
Under blackest night!
Under darkest stars!

I will rise!
And the stars will fall!
All who dare to stand
Shall be made to crawl!

And in the final hour of fading light
Your dreams of peace cast aside
Scattered like dust in the night

And in the final hour, my star will shine
Starlight and powers aligned
In the final fight

Inside the hearts of man
I see the darkness beckoning

You deal with a power
Far beyond your reckoning.Bowser:
Well lookie here!
It's even had a little speech prepared!

You done with monologues?
'Cause it's my turn! You should be scared!

Took my style? Well, I'm impressed!
I guess copycats want to copy the best!

But I got no patience
For imposters trying to take the throne!

I AM THE KOOPA KING!
You dare defy? I break your bones!

I have conquered galaxies
Now I've stepped down to see
If a shadow can bleed!

Koopa King will strike you down
I'll put you back in the ground
Learn why I wear the crown!And in the final hour of fading light
No one can challenge my might
Not while the fire burns bright!

And in the final hour, my star will shine
Starlight and powers aligned
In the final fight!

What's wrong there, critter?
Are you just a little parasite?

Hope you don't mind
That fighting tends to build an appetite!

Luigi, look, the core!

Hey, this is our chance, Mario!

Mario and Luigi:
Let's finish up this star!
You ready, bro?
Let's-a go!

Mario and Luigi:
In the journey we've come far
And now here we are
Now you see superstars

If you're still in there, Fawful
Know you still made one mistake

Thinking that we could never
Find a way to save-a the day

Mario and Luigi:
We will hold our hammers high
Watch a star fall
As we soar through the sky

We will rise! Brothers hand in hand!
We will never crawl! And here we stand!

And in the final hour of fading light
Dreams of peace taking flight
Pushing back the night

And in the final hour, our star will shine
Starlight and powers aligned
In the final fight!

Dark Star:
Inside the hearts of man
I see the darkness beckoning

You are a fool
To try and stand against the Koopa King!

Mario and Luigi:
To save the kingdoms
Fight for everyone and everything

Mario, Luigi, and Bowser:
The finale approaches
Now our victory we'll sing

Mario and Luigi:
In the journey we've come far
And now here we are
Now you see superstars

Dark Star:
Inside the hearts of man
I see the darkness beckoning

You deal with a power
Far beyond your reckoning

Dark Star and Bowser:
Dreams in darkness crash and burn
Now it's time you learn

Now it's my turn

Mario and Luigi:
We will rise
And the stars will fall
We will bring the light back to all!

Mario, Luigi, and Bowser:
And in the final hour of fading light
Stand tall against the night
While our hopes burn bright

And in the final hour, our star will shine
Starlight and powers aligned
In the final fight!
